# Unknown_Borrower
“Strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet”.

Lending money to strangers over the internet sounds like a recipe for disaster, but thousands of people are willingly doing it, through online marketplaces.
The web is making it easier to borrow money from a community of strangers using a concept called “unknown lending.” It’s not a new concept for entrepreneurs to reach out to “friends and family” for early stage funding. But now, entrepreneurs are using the web to find virtual “friends & family” — strangers willing to give them a loan. At a time when access to capital is still very tight, this is an interesting option. And this what the ‘Unknown Borrowers’ application does.
In this application, the lenders putting up the money are often smaller investors with relatively modest amounts of money wishing to make modest returns. Neither is there an expectation to a large annual bonus, so it keeps the offer affordable and nicely straightforward. This gives borrowers an easy access to money, which they repay in a scheduled time.
